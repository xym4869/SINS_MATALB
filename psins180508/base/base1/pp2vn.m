function vn = pp2vn(pos0, pos1, ts)
% Use differential positions to get average velocity.
% Denoted as vn = (pos1-pos0)/ts.
%
% Prototype: vn = pp2vn(pos0, pos1, ts)
% Inputs: pos0, pos1 - geographic position at time t0 and t1
%         ts - time interval between t0 and t1, i.e. ts = t1-t0
% Output: vn - average velocity
